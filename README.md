# Eduardo's 42 Piscine Journey  05/22/2023 - 06/16/2023 

- In this repository, you'll find the exercises that I tackled during my journey in the May-June Piscine at 42SP. Let me tell you, it was an incredible experience! For those intense weeks, I immersed myself in a world of coding challenges and personal growth.
 - From day one, I was faced with mind-boggling exercises that pushed me to my limits. Each task presented a new opportunity to learn and explore different programming concepts. So, as you explore this repository and go through the exercises, remember that each line of code represents a milestone in my journey. It is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and countless hours I invested in expanding my knowledge and honing my programming skills.

- I hope these exercises inspire and challenge you, just as they did for me. Grab your towel, enjoy the journey, don´t panic and trust the process!

#What is the Piscine?

  The piscine is a unique feature of Ecole 42 São Paulo's curriculum. It is an intensive coding bootcamp that spans a duration of four weeks. During the piscine, participants are fully immersed in a rigorous and challenging learning environment, where they engage in hands-on coding exercises and collaborative projects. We deeply understand how to use Shell and C as hard skills. This intense and immersive coding experience is designed to push you beyond your limits and transform you into a skilled and resourceful software engineer.

#Piscine Structure

• Bootcamp Duration: The piscine lasts for four weeks, during which participants dedicate themselves entirely to coding.

• Peer Learning: Collaboration and peer learning are fundamental to the piscine experience. You will work on projects and problem sets in teams, leveraging the power of collective intelligence.

• Project-Based Learning: The bootcamp emphasizes hands-on learning through real-world projects. You will tackle coding challenges that simulate industry scenarios, enabling you to develop practical skills.

• No Formal Instructors: At Ecole 42 São Paulo, the learning process is driven by your own curiosity and resourcefulness. Instead of traditional lectures, you'll have access to resources and mentors who can guide you along your learning journey.

#Values of Ecole 42 São Paulo

  Ecole 42 São Paulo stands on the foundation of several core values that shape the bootcamp experience:

• Meritocracy: The selection process is based on individual merit and potential, allowing talented individuals from all backgrounds to have equal opportunities.

• Peer-to-Peer Learning: Collaboration and teamwork are at the heart of the learning process. Through shared knowledge and collective problem-solving, participants develop a strong sense of community.

• Autonomous Learning: At Ecole 42 São Paulo, you are encouraged to take ownership of your education. The bootcamp provides the necessary resources and guidance, empowering you to explore and learn independently.

• Adaptability: The bootcamp challenges you to adapt and thrive in a fast-paced, ever-evolving industry. By facing a wide range of coding problems, you develop the versatility and resilience needed to succeed in the tech world.

#Conclusion

  The Piscine was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. It's like diving into a whole new world of learning. For 26 intense days, it feels like you've lived 10 months packed into just a few weeks. You learn so much about technology, but more importantly, you learn a lot about yourself, how to relate to others in a community, and how to work effectively as a team.

  The structure of the Piscine is quite interesting. It's basically a series of exercises in Shell and C programming that gradually increase in complexity and difficulty as you progress through the lists. You start with simpler tasks and gradually tackle more challenging ones.

  Now, here's the interesting part. The exercise instructions can be cryptic, and there's not much reference material provided by the school. They encourage you to ask your neighbors for help, turn to the almighty Google or "man" pages (RTFM!), and carefully read the examples. You're basically on your own to explore and acquire knowledge on the topics.

  At the beginning, it can be a bit overwhelming. Nobody really knows what to do or how to do it. It's all about trial and error. But as you make progress, you start sharing information with your fellow "pisciners" and a sense of mutual support emerges. You'll find people who are more willing to help and guide you through challenges, and you'll do the same for them. What made the Piscine truly unique was this supportive and collaborative environment. I met incredible individuals who shared the same passion for coding. We formed study groups, exchanged ideas, and helped each other through the tough times. The camaraderie and sense of community were palpable.

  Once you complete a set of exercises, it's time for evaluations. And here's the twist: instead of having someone who already knows the material correcting your work, it's all about peer assessment. You evaluate each other's work. It might sound odd, but it's actually a fantastic learning experience. Even if you're a bit behind the person you're evaluating, you can still provide valuable feedback. And when it's your turn to be evaluated, you have to explain your thought process and solutions to your evaluator. It's a great way to solidify your own knowledge and help others learn at the same time. Peer evaluations allowed me to not only showcase my skills but also appreciate the ingenuity of my peers. It was a humbling experience to evaluate their work and receive feedback in return. Through this process, we grew together, sharing knowledge and inspiring each other to improve.

  Throughout this journey, you'll face many challenges. It's not always smooth sailing in the Piscine. There will be moments of frustration when you struggle to understand something, solve a problem, or even compile a piece of code. But that's all part of the learning process. You'll experience a roller coaster of emotions, swinging between feelings of genius and moments of self-doubt multiple times a day. It takes resilience and emotional maturity to keep going.

  But trust the process, the progress you make is incredible. When I first started, I could barely read a line of C code and had no familiarity at all with Shell. Yet, after those intense 26 days, I was confidently writing complex code, reading and understanding code written by others, and thoroughly enjoying working with the shell. As I look back on my time in the Piscine, I am amazed at how much I've grown as a programmer and as an individual. I developed problem-solving skills, gained confidence in my coding abilities, and learned the importance of perseverance. Moreover, I discovered the joy of learning in a supportive community that nurtures growth.

  The most amazing part, though, is the personal growth you experience. You learn to work effectively in a team, how to learn independently, how to seek and share knowledge, and how to manage your time and life to make the most of the Piscine. You also discover your own limits and overcome self-limiting beliefs. Living respectfully in a community, creating a safe environment to expose your weaknesses, and nurturing your strengths is truly priceless. No book in the world (or guide to galaxy ;p) can teach you these things as effectively as this brief immersion in the Piscine.

  So, yes, it's challenging, but it's also an incredibly rewarding experience. It's like taking a plunge into a world of technology, personal growth, and teamwork. And when you see yourself teaching others and witnessing the ripple effect of knowledge spreading, it's truly a beautiful feeling. So, if you ever get the chance to dive into a Piscine, go for it! You won't regret!
