      # Conclusion

  The Piscine was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had. It's like diving into a whole new world of learning. For 26 intense days, it feels like you've lived 10 months packed into just a few weeks. You will learn much about technology, but more importantly, you will learn a lot about yourself, how to relate to others in a community and how to work effectively as a team.

  The structure of the Piscine is quite interesting. It's basically a series of exercises in Shell and C programming that gradually increase in complexity and difficulty as we progress through the lists. It starts with simpler tasks and gradually become more challenging ones.

  Now, here's the plot twist. The exercise instructions can be cryptic, and there's not much reference material provided by the school. They encourage you to ask your peers for help, turn to the almighty Google or "man" pages (RTFM!), and carefully read the given examples. You're basically on your own to explore and acquire knowledge on the topics.

  At the beginning, it can be a bit overwhelming. Nobody really knows what to do or how to do it. It's all about trial and error. But as you make progress and start sharing information with your fellow "pisciners", a sense of mutual support emerges. You'll find people who are more willing to help and guide you through the challenges, and you'll do the same for them. What made the Piscine truly unique for me was this supportive and collaborative environment. I met incredible individuals who shared the same passion for coding. We formed study groups, exchanged ideas, and helped each other through the tough times. The camaraderie and sense of community were present all the time.

  Once you complete a set of exercises, it's time for evaluations. And here's the interesting part: instead of having someone who already knows the material correcting your work, it's all about peer assessment. It might sound odd, but it's actually a rich learning experience. As evaluator, you can provide valuable feedback even if you're a bit behind the person you're evaluating. And when it's your turn to be evaluated, you have to explain your thought process and solutions to your evaluator. It's a great way to solidify your own knowledge and help others learn at the same time. Peer evaluations allowed me to not only showcase my skills but also appreciate the ingenuity of my peers. It was a humbling experience to evaluate their work and receive feedback in return. Through this process, we grew together, sharing knowledge and inspiring each other to improve.

  It's not always smooth sailing in the Piscine. Throughout this journey, you'll face many challenges. There will be many moments of frustration when you struggle to understand something, solve a problem, or even compile a piece of code. But that's all part of the learning process. You'll experience a roller coaster of emotions, swinging between feelings of genius and moments of self-doubt multiple times a day. It takes resilience and emotional maturity to keep going.

  But trust the process, the progress you make is incredible. When I first started, I could barely read a line of C code and had no familiarity at all with Shell. Yet, after those intense 26 days, I was confidently writing complex code, reading and understanding code written by others, and thoroughly enjoying working with Shell. As I look back on my dive in the Piscine, I am amazed at how much I've grown as a programmer and as an individual. I developed problem-solving skills, gained confidence in my coding abilities, and learned the importance of perseverance. Moreover, I discovered the joy of learning in a supportive community that nurtures growth.

  The most amazing part, though, is the personal growth you experience. You learn to work effectively in a team, how to learn independently, how to seek and share knowledge, and how to manage your time and life to make the most of the Piscine. You also discover your own limits and overcome self-limiting beliefs. Living respectfully in a community, creating a safe environment to expose your weaknesses, and nurturing your strengths is truly priceless. No book in the world (or guide to galaxy ;p) can teach you these things as effectively as this brief immersion in the Piscine.

  So, yes, it's challenging, but it's also an incredibly rewarding experience. It's like taking a plunge into a world of technology, personal growth, and teamwork. And when you see yourself teaching others and witnessing the ripple effect of knowledge spreading like wild fire, it's truly a beautiful feeling. So, if you ever get the chance to dive into a Piscine, go for it! You won't regret!
